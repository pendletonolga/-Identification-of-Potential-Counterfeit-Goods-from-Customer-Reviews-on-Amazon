# -Identification-of-Potential-Counterfeit-Goods-from-Customer-Reviews-on-Amazon
The text mining project focused on developing models to identify product reviews flagging potentially counterfeit goods on Amazon.com.
The project progressed through data acquisition (scraping), labeling, and modeling.
By analyzing lexical patterns in product reviews, I developed models that can effectively flag reviews with potential signs of counterfeit products
The analysis revealed that specific keywords were key indicators in identifying potentially counterfeit goods, providing valuable insights for counterfeit detection systems.
